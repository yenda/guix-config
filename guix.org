<davexunit> yenda: you should use 'guix build -K' to keep the failed
    build around in /tmp
<mark_weaver> yenda: if you build with 'guix build -K' to keep the
    failed build directory, then you can re-run the tests from that
    failed directory, manually.
<mark_weaver> the failed build directory will be in /tmp/nix-build-*
<mark_weaver> in there will be a 'environment-variables' file with the
    environment variable settings used during the build.
<mark_weaver> then you can "env -i $(which bash)" to spawn a shell
    with an empty environment, then source that file to get the
    environment variable settings, and then go from there.
<mark_weaver> it is not quite the same as the build environment, since
    it is not in a chroot and not isolated from the network, but still
    often useful

<mark_weaver> probably run "make check" from the top-level directory,
    although it looks like you also need to set the HOME environment
    variable to something that can be written to (it's done in the
    pre-check phase)

<mark_weaver> okay, so the problem is that nothing was installed in
    the output directory
<mark_weaver> for projects that have a 'configure' script, that's
    taken care of because gnu-build-system passes --prefix=<output> to
    configure
<amz3> how do you know?
<amz3> (that nothing was installed in the output directory)
<mark_weaver> otherwise, you need to do it in some other way.  for
    projects with makefiles, sometimes it can be done by including
    PREFIX=<output> in the make-flags.
<davexunit> amz3: because the output directory wasn't created
<mark_weaver> amz3: because of the error message "failed to produce
    output path"
<amz3> got it
<mark_weaver> the name output directory can be obtained with
    (assoc-ref outputs "out") within a phase procedure if it accepts
    the 'outputs' keyword argument.
<mark_weaver> (in general, there can be more than one output, hence
    the lookup)
<mark_weaver> somehow, that directory needs to be created, and
    probably have things like /bin and /lib subdirectories.
<mark_weaver> the thing is, usually if you fail to tell it where to
    install, it will try to install somewhere in /usr and fail.
<mark_weaver> so I suspect that it didn't try to install at all
<cjbarnes18`> good evening folks, having troubles installing guixos in
    a vm, am attempting to install using USB media. fails downloading
    ../bootstrap/../guile-2.0.9.tar.xz
<amz3> the fact that phase procedure are are not lambda is
    strange. out is an argument but it doesn't appear.
